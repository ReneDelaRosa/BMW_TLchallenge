# BMW_TLchallenge
Codes developed for the BMW challenge in Talent Land 2018:

1. Mapping the area (Follow a pre stablished route and avoid obstacles with routines).
2. Calculate a route (2 different algorithms based in the results of mapping were tested,
'Ant colony' and 'Breadth-first search, BFS').
3. Follow a route.
